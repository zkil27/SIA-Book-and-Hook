## 2026-09-03 — Add hard rule requiring all changes to be documented

**What:** Added a "MANDATORY: document every change" section near the top of
`AGENTS.md`, reinforced it as a bullet in the "Non-negotiable rules" list, and
created this `docs/changelog.md` file as the required change log.

**Why:** The team wants a hard, enforceable rule so that no AI-made edit ever
ships undocumented — keeping `docs/` trustworthy for the prof check and defense.

**Impact:** From now on, every code/config/schema/dependency/script change must
add an entry here and update any affected topic doc (`data-model.md`,
`scope.md`, `deployment.md`, `project-overview.md`) in the same turn. A change
is not complete until its documentation exists.

## 2026-09-03 — Add plain-language project overview

**What:** Created `docs/project-overview.md`, a beginner-friendly guide to the
whole project (product summary, the stock ledger, the seven entities, common
prof questions, out-of-scope items, tools, repo tour, demo script, glossary).

**Why:** So a team member who isn't strong in coding can confidently explain and
defend the project during the professor's check.

**Impact:** New documentation only; no code changed.
